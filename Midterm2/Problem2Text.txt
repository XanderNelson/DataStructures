***********Elements in the heap are **********
31.5 55 10 6.5 2 4 5 1.1
After heap sort:

1.1 4 2 6.5 5 10 55 31.5
***********Elements in the heap are **********
1.7 5.6 4 8 3
After heap sort:
8 4 3 5.6 1.7


For this problem, I tried to implement the heap sort in the provided
function definition. I couldnt quite get it to work. I know
that if I would have added a recursive helper function I
could have recursivly sorted the heap while using the left and right
childs, similar to what I tried to do here.
