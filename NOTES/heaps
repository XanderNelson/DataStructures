Binary Heaps

  What are they
    -binary tree
    -not a BST
    -satisfies one of the heap ordering properties
    -min-heap
        -the value of each node is greater than or equal
          to the value of its parent
    -has to be a complete tree

    Applications- sorting, priority queues

    Heap Implementation


    Min Heap ADT

    public:
      init();
      insert(value);
      peek();
      printHeap();
      extractMin();

    private:
      int *heap;//point to first element of array
      int capacity;//optional
      int currentSize; //how many elements in heap

      contructor:
      MinHeap(int c)
      {
        currentSize = 0;
        capacity = c;
        heap = new int[capacity];
      }

      insert(value)
        if currentSize == capacity
          "full heap"
        else
