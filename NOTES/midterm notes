Which of the following is true about open addressing?
hashed values will always be found in the table

You are given a hash function f(x) = x % 2, where x is the value to be hashed and f(x) is the hash address. Linear probing is used to resolve collisions.
The hash function receives the input {7, 6, 4, 3, 10} in that order. Place each number in the hash table at its correct address..
0-6
1-7
2-4
3-3
4-10

Consider a binary max-heap implemented using an array. Which one of the following array represents a binary max-heap?

What is the content of the array after two delete (extractMax) operations on the correct answer to the previous question?
14,13,12,8,10

What is the time complexity of searching for the minimum element in a binary max heap containing n elements?
O( n )

What is (are) the data structure(s) used for DFS and BFS?
stack and queue
