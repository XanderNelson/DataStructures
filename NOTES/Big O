how does the algorithm scale with input size
what if
  for j=0; N-1
    for i = 0; N-1
      cout << a[i]*;;//50ms

  data structure operations
    arrays: access O(1)
            search O(N)
            insert O(N)
            delete O(N)

    linked list:  access O(N)
                  search O(N)
                  insert O(1)
                  delete O(1)


    double linked list insert: at head O(1)
                                  tail O(1)
                                  middle O(1)
                        deletion at head O(1)
                                  tail O(1)
                                  middleO(1)

    Binary search tree (balanced)
        A,S,I,D   O(log N)

    Stack
      A-O(N)  S-O(N) I-O(1)  D-O(1)

    Stack
      Data Structure that allows a specific order in which
      operations on its data can be performed.
        -can only add to the top(push)
        -can only remove from top (pop)

      usage of a stack:
        e.g. call stack during program execution
          -currently active subroutines
